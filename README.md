## Who Am I ? 

"We build technology solutions with lasting impact, driven by growth mindset and continuous learning."

We co-founded Deep Blue Digital, a global tool discovery platform for creators. While it didn't achieve planned scale, we embraced it as a pivotal learning opportunity that deepened our understanding of product-market fit, stakeholder alignment.

Our foundation at 42 Wolfsburg and AIESEC cultivated our growth mindset in operational execution, strategic problem-solving, and international collaboration.

Our next chapter focuses on identifying and building long-term business partnerships with organizations that share our commitment to continuous improvement, sustainable growth, and AI-enhanced strategic execution.
